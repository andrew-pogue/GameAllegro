lazy loading with std::optional<T>

concurrency:
    thread for player input
    thread for updating game logic
    thread for rendering

ui text and elements that are attached to/follow the display
main menu and game menu
tab to change default game font
scroll to zoom in and out (increase/decrease font size)

font handling should be done by Game
every draw function can be put in one place
al_wrapper should only handle destroying of resources
template wrapper that accepts custom destroy function

entity have public debug bool that debugs that one entity
remove font from text (or turn into string)
keep color on text

game world position is in tiles not pixels
    so a position of (2,4,3) translates to:
        2 * g_tile_size
        4 * g_tile_size
        3 * g_tile_size
ui position is still in pixels
    such that
        x < g_window_width + g_fov_leeway
        y < g_window_height + g_fov_leeway
        x > - (g_window_width + g_fov_leeway)
        y > - (g_window_height + g_fov_leeway)
            these bounds refers to the display constraints
                entities outside of the display constrains aren't rendered


test flecs system lambda captures
test flecs event OnSet
Whats the differences between using on_demand versus using a query?
can you remove a component from within a query or system?

DONE smooth move
DONE instant move
teleport

ghost trail effect
    that leaves low brightness, transparent copy of its glyph in previous tile
    effect dissapears quickly over time

spiral enter effect
    used when entering level
    starting at center of screen, tiles are rendered one at a time 
        in a spiral patter around player, spiralling outward till entire display is rendered
circular/box enter effect
    used when changing z level ??
    starting at center of screen tiles around player are rendered,
        then tiles around rendered tiles, until entire screen is rendered
spiral exit effect
circular exit effect

try implementing hexagonal tiles?
glyphs of various sizes?
    2x2 tile glyph
    3x3 tile glyph

highlight effect
    font_size is increased on glyph while highlighted
    or bold font is used on glyph while highligthed

sneak effect
    italic font is used on glyph while highlighted
    and/or color is faded

fade in & fade out effect
    type 1 where color brightness gradually increases/decreases
    type 2 where transparency gradually decreases/increases

blink effect
    glyph rotates between render-enabled to render-disabled

render priority system to ensure some entites get rendered before/after others

in game level editor

player faces a direction and can change direction
    display rotates/orientes to reflect that direction

revamp input processing to include command-pattern
revamp how z-value is handled

Cooldown component
	unsigned short frames;

KeyPress component
	ALLEGRO_KEY key
	unsigned short frames;

MousePress component
	mouse button
	unsigned short frames;
	
implement hold for a few frames (1-3?) so that moving diagonally with arrow keys
    or pushing multiple keys at once is easier

fix the screen from jerking around when moving player in circle
